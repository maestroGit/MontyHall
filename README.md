The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975.[1][2] It became famous as a question from reader Craig F. Whitaker's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990:

I have tried to simulate the possibilities to change an o maintain a door, showing at the end the basic statistics.

If you make more plays, you will see how your probability of winning by changing your selection door is better than maintaining your choice.

You choose a door and before knowing if it has a prize or not. One of the other two doors you have not chosen opens, showing that the prize is not there. At that point, you are offered the chance to change your choice for the door that remains to be opened or keep the chosen door.

Two curiosities, one psychological and one mathematical.

First: We do not want to change our decision
Second: You win more often if you trade.
